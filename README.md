# Hi, there 👋

I'm a Front-End Developer focused on building clean, responsive, and accessible user interfaces.

Experienced in converting Figma designs into production-ready HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript for real client projects and CMS handoffs.

Currently building and refining UI-focused projects (dashboards, landing pages, auth flows) while expanding React skills.

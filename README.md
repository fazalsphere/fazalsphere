# Hi, there 👋

I’m Fazal, a front-end developer based in Pakistan.

From landing pages to full front-end systems, I enjoy transforming design concepts into polished, production-ready websites.  

Outside of code, you’ll often find me exploring the latest technology, hitting the gym, driving the cars, or diving into tech content. I also enjoy sharing ideas and connecting with people who are building the future.  

**Fun Facts:**

• I don’t like coffee, but I can code for hours with pure motivation

• I’m obsessed with perfecting pixel-to-code precision

• I dream of building a tech empire like Amazon or Microsoft one day!
